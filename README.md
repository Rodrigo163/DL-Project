# Deep Learning SoSe20 Final Project

This project is based on the paper: [Vinyals et al. Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator. CVPR 2015.](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Vinyals_Show_and_Tell_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)
You should use one of the pretrained CNN image recognition models and the COCO dataset from torchvision: <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html> 
On top of the recognition model, you should train an image captioning system which generates a caption sentence based on a representation vector computed by the CNN model.
